- 👋 Hi, I'm Latisha (@TishaMonique). Friends call me Tish or Tisha.  I'm a multi-skilled experienced business support specialist. I am a recent graduate earning a B.S. in Business Systems from East Carolina University in Greenville, NC (May 2022). 

- 👀  I would like to offer my unique blend of experiences to a learning experience design, SaaS, or product development team. Industries of interest include fintech, blockchain, real estate, eCommerce. Roles of interest include learning experience design, user training or on-boarding, business analyst, UX research, UX writing, or user testing. If you would like to talk about any of these potential areas of interest, then please feel free to connect with me today.

- 🌱 Currently, I am engaging in regular self-study to learn software develop support skills to prepare for entry-level roles.

- 💞️ For example, I've completed a number of LinkedIn Learning modules on the following sujects: QA testing process and tools, business analyst, and SQL basics. Recently, I completed a SCRUM PO certification through the Scrum Alliance and Google's UX Design Foundations module (Coursera). The past five years, I've been freelancing part-time off and on as virtual marketing support or web designer for clients and personal projects.  

Relative to learning experience and content design, I wrote a <a href="https://latishagrady.com/goodbye-anxiety-book//">30-Day Anxiety Relief Survival Guide</a> with strategies I used to overcome anxiety.  

- 💞️ A recent summer 2022 project was completing an urgent request for a sales event page for a local nonprofit to market and sell tickets for an important fundraising event featuring the Lt. Governor of North Carolina.  Event sold out.
