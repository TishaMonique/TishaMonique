- 👋 Hi, I'm Latisha (@TishaMonique). Friends call me Tish or Tisha.  I'm a multi-skilled experienced business support specialist. I am a recent graduate earning a B.S. in Business Systems from East Carolina University in Greenville, NC (May 2022). 

- 👀 I'm pursuing a career transition into software development support. Roles of interest include: QA testing, business analyst (PO), or technical writing. 

- 🌱 Currently, I am engaging in regular self-study to learn software develop support skills to prepare for entry-level roles.

- 💞️ For example, I've completed a number of LinkedIn Learning modules on the following sujects: QA testing process and tools, business analyst, and SQL basics. Recently, I completed a SCRUM PO certification through the Scrum Alliance and Google's UX Design Foundations module (Coursera). The past five years, I've been freelancing part-time off and on as virtual marketing support or web designer for clients and personal projects.

- 💞️ A recent summer 2022 project was completing an urgent request for a sales event page for a local nonprofit to market and sell tickets for an important fundraising event featuring the Lt. Governor of North Carolina.  Event sold out.
