- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Latisha (@TishaMonique). Friends call me Tish or Tisha. 

I thrive in agile environments where I get to set up processes that drive my team or client toward success in achieving business goals.  I am seeking an opportunity to  leverage my fintech, web design, bookkeeping, human resources and document and data management experiences and offer them to a SaaS, PaaS, IaaS development or  implementation team. Preferably fintech. The aggregate variety of all my work experiences prepare me for the following roles implementation consultant, analyst, or HRIS analyst or data manager.
