- 👋 Hi, I'm Latisha (@TishaMonique). Friends call me Tish or Tisha. 

I thrive in agile environments where I get to set up processes that drive my team or client toward success in achieving business goals.  I am seeking an opportunity to  leverage my fintech, web design, bookkeeping, human resources and document and data management experiences as your next HRIS or Business Analyst. The aggregate variety of all my work experiences prepare me for this role.
