- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Latisha (@TishaMonique). Friends call me Tish or Tisha. 

I am a versatile and collaborative professional seeking to leverage and transition my business operations and project support experiences (serving UX research, product design, accounting, and human resource teams) into a business analyst or adjacent role. Skills include process improvement, research, creating user stories, project workflows, dashboards, and delivering actionable insights to teams for decision making and enhancing business efficiency. 

To demonstrate and show showcase UX research and product business analysis relevant skills and strategic thinking, I initiated and is working on a project that is available for review upon request.
